      <p>
        To create the page you see here, we placed a<code>react-page.jsx</code>{' '}
        file alongside the other pages on our site. That's because component
        pages are like any other template on your 11ty site, just with 1 extra
        superpower:
        <strong>you can hydrate the page with JavaScript.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Hydrating this page</h2>

      <p>
        We opted-in to shipping JavaScript using the <code>hydrate</code> key in
        our
        <code>frontMatter</code>. Learn more on
        <a href="https://slinkity.dev/docs/partial-hydration/">
          our partial hydration docs.
        </a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Tip: try setting <code>hydrate</code> to <code>"none"</code>, or
        removing the key entirely. The counter below should stop working! This
        is because we're no longer sending our component to the client,
        effectively turning React into just another templating language.
      </p>

      <p className="counter">
        <span>Count: {count}</span>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+ 1</button>
      </p>

      <h3>Front matter</h3>

      <p>
        Our included <code>frontMatter</code> wires up the layout and passes
        information "upstream" for other templates to read from. It works the
        same way for component-based pages as it does for
        <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter/">
          11ty's front matter
        </a>
        . Here, the <code>title</code> key is accessible from any layout
        templates applied to our page.
